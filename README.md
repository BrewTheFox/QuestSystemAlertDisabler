# System Alert Disabler for Meta Quest Devices

This program allows users to enable or disable system alerts on Meta Quest VR devices, such as temperature warnings. It supports all generations of Meta Quest devices and includes functions for shutting down or rebooting the device.

## Features

- **Enable/Disable Alerts**: This central button allows you to toggle system alerts such as temperature warnings on or off.
- **Device Selector**: The dropdown menu in the center lets you choose which Meta Quest device you want to manage. It supports all Meta Quest generations.

## Important Warning

**Disabling system alerts WILL permanently damage the power menu of your Meta Quest device.** Once the alerts are disabled, the power menu will stop functioning correctly, making it impossible to reboot or shut down the device using the standard options.
